Here’s a concise summary of **Method 1** for synthetic data generation based on your plan:

### **Method 1: Cluster-wise Distribution Fitting and Sampling**

1. **Cluster Analysis**
   - For each cluster, you may extract the archetype (centroid) and geometric parameters (spread, variance, etc.), but if you use principal component (PC) projections (e.g., PC1), you can skip explicit geometric analysis for distribution fitting.

2. **Feature Extraction for Fitting**
   - For each cluster, select a 1D feature (e.g., PC1 values, or distances from centroid) to represent the cluster’s main variation.

3. **Distribution Fitting**
   - For each candidate base distribution (e.g., Gaussian, Beta, Gamma, Lognormal, etc.), fit the distribution to the selected 1D data using a tool like `fitter` or `distfit`.

4. **Model Selection**
   - Evaluate the fit using statistical tests (KS, Anderson-Darling), and information criteria (AIC, BIC).
   - Select the distribution with the best fit as the base distribution for that cluster.

5. **Distribution Fitting and Sampling**
   - Fit the selected base distribution to the cluster’s data.
   - Generate synthetic samples from this fitted distribution, ensuring samples are within the observed value range.

6. **Special Case: Small Clusters**
   - If a cluster has too few points (below a threshold K), skip fitting and use random sampling.

7. **Evaluation**
   - Compare real and synthetic data using:
     - Goodness-of-fit tests (KS, Anderson-Darling, AIC, BIC)
     - Distributional similarity (histograms, KDE, Wasserstein distance)
     - Summary statistics (mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis)
     - Geometric properties (centroid, covariance)
     - Cluster structure (silhouette score, re-clustering consistency)
     - Visualization (PCA/t-SNE/UMAP plots)

**Key Points:**
- Use 1D projections (like PC1) for fitting, which simplifies the process.
- Automate distribution selection using statistical fit criteria.
- Evaluate the realism of synthetic data with both statistical and visual methods.

High level plan 1  for the code :
--------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------

1. After the clsutering, for each cluster, need to do the following analysis:
    a. Archetype of the cluster
    b. Geometric parameters of each cluster

2. Using the above results, need to compute a funtion say G which is dependent on a. and b. 

                    G = Funtion( Archetype, Geometric parameters)

3. The result from this function G, will be used as the criteria for selecting base distribution.

                    Base distribution = Selection from options based on G for each cluster

4. Base distribution, possible options : Gaussian, Normal, Random, Beta, etc. 
5. After selecting the appropriate base distribution using results from G function, we will fit the 
distribution to each of the cluster.

                    Current distribution for cluster j = Fitting Base Distribution (Cluster j)

6. For clusters with very few points, say below a certain threshold K, skip the fitting approach and switch 
to the good old random sampling.

7. After getting the best possible current distribution for each clsuter, also need to evaluate he 
goodness-of-fit checks, few statistical tests, for example: KS, AIC, BIC

8. Then we do the sampling from each of the clusters using the current distribution. The no of sample points 
to be user defined bounded by the max and min values possible.

Evaluation tech:

1. Goodness-of-Fit for Fitted Distributions
Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) Test:
Compare the empirical distribution of real cluster data to the fitted distribution.
Anderson-Darling Test:
Another test for distributional similarity, especially sensitive to tails.
AIC/BIC:
Compare AIC/BIC values for different candidate distributions to ensure the best fit was chosen.
2. Distributional Comparison Between Real and Synthetic Data
Histogram/KDE Plots:
Overlay histograms or kernel density estimates for real and synthetic data for each cluster and feature.
Earth Mover’s Distance (Wasserstein Distance):
Quantifies the difference between two distributions.
3. Summary Statistics
Compare Means, Variances, Skewness, Kurtosis:
For each cluster and feature, compare these statistics between real and synthetic data.
4. Geometric Properties
Centroid Distance:
Compare the mean vectors of real and synthetic clusters.
Covariance Matrix Comparison:
Compare the spread and orientation (covariance) of real and synthetic clusters.
5. Cluster Structure
Silhouette Score:
Compare the silhouette scores of real and synthetic clusters to assess compactness and separation.
Re-clustering Consistency:
Cluster the synthetic data and check if the structure matches the real data.
6. Visualization
PCA/t-SNE/UMAP Plots:
Visualize real and synthetic data in reduced dimensions to check for structural similarity.
