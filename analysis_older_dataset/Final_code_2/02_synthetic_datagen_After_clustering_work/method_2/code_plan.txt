High level plan 2 for the code :
--------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------

Your Plan (Restated)
Analyze each cluster for its archetype (center) and geometric parameters (shape, spread, possible value ranges).
Use these to select and fit a base distribution for each cluster, then sample synthetic data accordingly.

Alternative Method: Use the Paper’s Synthetic Cluster Generator
Instead of fitting distributions manually: Use the tool/method from the paper (e.g., repliclust) to generate synthetic clusters directly.

How it works:
1. Input the archetype (mean/center), geometric parameters (principal axes, variances, 
aspect ratio, etc.), and value ranges for each cluster.
2. The tool will generate synthetic data points that match the specified cluster geometry
and distributional properties.

Advantages:
1. Ensures the synthetic clusters have realistic shapes, spreads, and
overlaps as defined by your extracted parameters.
2. Reduces manual coding and leverages a well-tested synthetic data generator.
3. Can control for cluster overlap, imbalance, and other high-level properties 
as described in the paper.

How to Integrate This:
1. Extract archetype and geometric parameters from your real clusters.
2. Map these parameters to the input format required by the paper’s tool (e.g., repliclust).
3. Generate synthetic clusters using the tool, specifying the number of samples, value ranges, 
and other constraints as needed.


Evaluation :
1. Distributional Similarity
Histogram/KDE Comparison:
Plot histograms or kernel density estimates of key features for both real and synthetic data, cluster by cluster.
Statistical Tests:
Use tests like the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test or Earth Mover’s Distance (Wasserstein distance) to quantify similarity between distributions.
2. Geometric Properties
Centroid Distance:
Compare the centroids (means) of real and synthetic clusters.
Covariance/Shape:
Compare covariance matrices or principal components (PCA) to see if the spread and orientation match.
3. Cluster Assignment Consistency
Re-clustering:
Cluster the combined real and synthetic data. Check if synthetic points are assigned to the same clusters as their real counterparts.
Silhouette Score:
Compare silhouette scores for real and synthetic clusters to assess separation and compactness.
4. Visualization
Scatter Plots (PCA/t-SNE):
Visualize real and synthetic points together in 2D/3D using PCA or t-SNE to check for overlap and similarity in structure.
5. Summary Statistics
Compare Means, Variances, Skewness, Kurtosis:
For each feature and cluster, compare these statistics between real and synthetic data.
6. Overlap and Coverage
Convex Hull/Bounding Box:
Check if synthetic data covers the same region in feature space as real data.
Cluster Overlap Metrics:
Use LDA-based overlap or other overlap metrics to compare real and synthetic cluster separations.
